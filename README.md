Hi! I'm Adam. I make software to help organizations do great things at [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/). Among other things, I'm a University of Chicago alum, ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, and a proud New Yorker.

Some things I love include writing, travel, aviation, spreadsheets, and various coding side projects, including my personal website [adammarcstevenson.com](https://adammarcstevenson.com/), which is built entirely with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

If you want to chat or have a coffee, [get in touch](https://adammarcstevenson.com/contact)!
